# Peerdea Version 1.0

## Overview

Peerdea enables amateur creators, designers, and innovators to receive effective feedback on their concepts from a group of trusted peers.

## Contributors

Peerdea's current team of contributors: Judy Zhang (B.S. Information systems, Spring 2020), Michael Chang (M.S. Electrical and Computer Engineering, Fall 2019), Jenny Yu (B.S. Electrical and Computer Engineering, Spring 2021), led by Yasmine Kotturi (Ph.D. Human-Computer Interaction).

## Peerdea workflow

First, a user is prompted to either create a new group, or join an existing group. Once the user creates or joins a group, they are then guided to share a design concept. If they chose to share, they can include a series of images to capture their concept (photos of sketches, prototypes, completed designs), as well a short story to describe their concept. Whether they share a concept or not, the user is able to view all of the concepts shared within their group, as well as give feedback on their peers' concepts. Feedback exchange is possible in two ways: 1. a simple "Yes" or "Heart" to show quick encouragement on a peer's concept, or 2. a "Yes and..." where in addition to showing encouragement, the feedback giver is able to offer text-based feedback (the "and..." portion). Text-based feedback exchanges are scaffolded with two different sentence starters ("I like..." and "I wish..."). All completed "ands..." are then displayed following each concept.
